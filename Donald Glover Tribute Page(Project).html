  <!--This first paragraph will be about my introduction to who Donald Glover is-->
  <ul>Introduction</ul>
  <p1>
    <body>For all the times I saw Troy Barnes act silly but wholesome at the same time I never realized one thing. That was that he was none other
    than CHILDISH GAMBINO! See it all started when I was sitting in a movie theater with mom and you know <br>how they play little commercials before the
    actual previews play. Well at the time there was a little clip for Beats headphones and among the artists singing their songs<br> was Donald Glover.
    Now at first I was confused so I asked mom if that was the guy from Community and sure enough it was. Then it began, my inspiration and admiration for 
    a legendary artist who reminded me of me. The way he carries himself on screen whether it be<br>comedic, melancholy, or for seriousness. It all
    made feel relieved that their was someone who looked like me had perplexing questions like me and was extravagantly creative.</body>
  </p1>  
  <!--Second paragraph will be on the subject of his music-->
  <ul>The Music Behind It All</ul>
  <p2>
    <body>Now let us proceed further down the rabbit hole and onto the subject of his music. The year was 2013 when I first heard a snippet of his summer single
    3005. I swear to that I had that song on every burned CD and phone and even my PSP at the time. The melody, the beat, the hook, and even the<br>interprative
    message behind the song however you viewed was and still is what makes that song so great for me. Donald always has a way of constructing his music<br>
    in a way that would allow anyone should they enter his realm feel enlightened to something near other dimensional. It eventually led me to his 
    previous albums like Camp, Royals, and when it finally released Beacuse The Internet.<br>Moreover, these projects from my perspectives seem to resembled 
    a lost soul looking for his identity or someone who longs for a real connection with someone or something. For example, the song 3005 has a hook where 
    he sings, "I'll be right by your side til 3005", that line felt as if he was conveying his undying loyalty and love for someone he cares about and
    that no matter what he'll always be there. It still feels powerful to me to this day honestly. Another example, would be Sweatpants or Telegraph Ave, all are 
    in their own way short stories about the questions that Childish Gambino and Donald Glover ask on an everyday basis. It's just simply amazing what 
    he can create given whatever tools are in front of him.

  <ul>The Experiments of The Projects</ul>
  <p3>
    <body>Flash forward to 2016, my junior year of high school around Christmas time Donald released Awaken, My Love. A funk psychodelic journey into his private
    life this time around which was new refreshing and down right unexpected. His major hit which would be later heard in Jordan Peele's Get Out Redbone was
    a breakthrough to everyone out there who never heard of Gambino before or didn't realize that it was his voice they heard.<br> Everyone was blown away with
    what he just produced. An eerie funk of the old days of 60's woodstock era and a little bit of 70's peace. After a few 100 listens to his whole album I noticed
    expressed more of what was behind the scenes in his current life from his first love to the birth of his first child. Donald was experimenting with
    showing himself more and I digged that he did it in his own way without the tabloids clammering to know what his true intentions of this album was. That's 
    what I love about the music, the experiments and the willingness to explore new sound and evolution and not sticking to the same thing everytime.

  <ul>Works and Collaborations</ul>
  <p4>
    <body>
      Among Donald's alluring creativity there are his many collaborations and notable works in from his music 
      all the way to his acting. From most of social media's knowledge he is most known for his beginnings on the hit comedy
      show Community. But his true roots lie in his writing back in the earlier days of another comedy called 30 Rock.
      Through actress Tina Fey he began writing for episodes on the show even making a cameo as a young version
      of Tracy Morgans character. Moreover, as of late Donald and his brother Stephen have crafted a beautifully critically acclaimed
      series known as Atlanta. Now, moving on to his musical adaptaions. Childish Gambino has by far the best 
      sense of levity and experimentation when it comes to his creative works and always projects the world 
      but in from his point of view.
